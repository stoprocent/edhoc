For some huge applications, it may be OK to put the complete OSCORE and EDHOC implementation in the TEE. For others however which have to be highly secure, it is better to put only the crypto operations and the keys in TEE.\r\n\r\n In our paper (still not published. When it gets published I will put a reference here) we are considering the latter case. Here is the subsection about sensitive assets:\r\n \r\n \"Sensitive Assets. By analyzing the EDHOC specifica-\r\ntion we identified the following key material as sensitive: 1)\r\nthe long term authentication keys, i.e. secret signature keys\r\nor secret static DH keys, 2) the public authentication key of\r\nthe other party when RPK is used and the root public key of\r\nthe CA when certificates are used, 3) intermediate EDHOC\r\nkeys and 4) the result of the EDHOC protocol. An attacker\r\nhaving access to one of those keys may: 1) impersonate the\r\ndevice by leaking its long term authentication keys, 2) fool\r\nthe device that its talking to a legit peer by changing the\r\npeer\u2019s public key or the root public key of the CA and 3) com-\r\npromise the security of EDHOC by leaking or manipulating\r\nits intermediate keys or the end result of the protocol.\r\nAlso sensitive are all cryptographic routines using the\r\nkeys. If these routines are manipulated, they may leak the\r\nkeys or allow the EDHOC protocol to succeed although the\r\ncommunication peer is not authentic.\"\r\n \r\n \r\n I think letting the ephemeral secret key outside the TEE is not a good idea because in this way an attacker outside the TEE may calculate the derived key.

The input fits into\r\n  one block anyway, so it will still be fast. For example,\r\n  a=SHA256(0|k_priv) and seed=SHA256(1|k_priv).\r\n- It is not trivially possible to replace the inner hash SHA512(seed|M)\r\n  with SHA256(seed|M). However, it turns out that the order in fact\r\n  does allow this replacement.\r\n- If one wants noisy signatures, one way is to replace SHA256(seed|M)\r\n  with SHA256(seed|M)^noise. The noise must be independent of the\r\n  private key and seed, but otherwise bad noise (including completely\r\n  broken one) will not cause immediate catastrophic failure.\r\n- If one wants randomized signatures, due to the same reasons as why\r\n  the inner hash may be replaced, it is recommended to generate more\r\n  randomness than 256 bits, and then use SHA256 to squash it to 256\r\n  bits.

From John's slides at [1], I gather that bad number of ECDSA have been due to unoptimized implementations of P-256 and that on some platforms ECDSA and Ed25519 have \"equal performance\". More importantly, the state-of-the-art constrained devices have dominantly ECDSA hardware accelerators. If we are to optimize for the constrained side, as we usually do, this indicator favors ECDSA. Since we are talking about hardware, this is expected to remain for at least the next 5-10 years, considering what is already deployed. \r\n\r\nIn terms of (b), an implementation of EdDSA requires SHA-512, in addition to SHA-256 that is needed by EDHOC, so two hash functions. Again, constrained devices have dominantly SHA-256 acceleration, without clear plans on adding SHA-512 to the mix. Code footprint favors ECDSA.\r\n\r\nIn terms of (c), there is no difference.\r\n\r\nMy conclusion from (a), (b) and (c) is that the argument on the negative impact of ECDSA on performance in constrained devices does not hold and that ECDSA is in fact favored performance-wise.\r\n\r\nSecurity-wise, Ed25519 is favored. There have been speculations on the possible backdoors in the NIST P-256 curve. As far as I am aware, these are still considered speculations. The problem are the attacks on the signature algorithm, ECDSA. A notable example is Minerva [1], an implementation attack. What are the other attacks on ECDSA we should take into consideration? Do these attacks affect the hardware-accelerated implementations in constrained devices we are targeting?\r\n\r\n[1] https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/interim-2020-lake-04/materials/slides-interim-2020-lake-04-sessa-edhoc-issues-after-03-00 (slide 15)\r\n[2] https://minerva.crocs.fi.muni.cz",

That is a different example, similar to the second example.\r\n\r\nIn the first example it is illustrated that the Initiator tells the Responder that it supports 5,6,7 and that it proposes to use 5. The initiator could in this case have sent just 5, that would have been a different example. Some of the illustrations intended with this example is to show a) that the Initiator can inform the Responder about suites it supports, b) that the Initiator can support more suites than it sends, and c) an example of the second message from the Initiator [6,5,6] which protects against downgrade attacks since it repeats all information about more preferred suites.\r\n\r\nIn the second example, the proposed suites by the Initiator are disjoint from those proposed by the Responder, which is addressing your second point. Again the suites of the first message are repeated in the second message and the selected is added. Given that the supported suites are the same in the first and second example, but the initiator is showing different suites in message_1 in the two examples, we thought it would be clear that yet other variants are possible, including only showing one suite, which would then be the selected suite. Can we make the examples more clear? ",

The developer would have to find the raw AES and ChaCha20 functions and make sure to implement the stream ciphers. This is doable but a bit complicated. We would like to keep implementation simple.\r\n\r\nThe solution with deriving a long key and XORing was simple but raised a lot of questions as XOR encryption has in the past been used in insecure ways (repeating a short key....). HMAC-SHA-256 on the other hand could very have higher security bounds than AES-128-CTR.\r\n\r\nI think just removing the tag is the best overall solution.

The Initiator (as CoAP client) sends an OSCORE-protected request, embedding both EDHOC Message 3 and the actual request payload protected with the just-established Security Context, as per the proposed approach.\r\n\r\n2. The Responder (as CoAP server) processes EDHOC Message 3. If this processing fails, the Responder replies with an unprotected EDHOC error message. As of today, this would be a 2.04 response, hence a successful response for CoAP.\r\n\r\nHowever, as per [2], \"A successful response to a request with the OSCORE option SHALL contain the OSCORE option.\" Thus, when receiving the unprotected 2.04 response above, the Initiator would experience an OSCORE failure, which is fine and consistent per se.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the OSCORE processing happens before the EDHOC processing on the Initiator, it might become impossible to access and process the actual response content, i.e. the EDHOC Error Message. Whether which of the two processing comes first is implementation specific.\r\n\r\nAn easy way out would be to rather have the EDHOC Error Message sent as a CoAP error response. On the Initiator, the response would then be not discarded by OSCORE, and would ensure a correct processing of the EDHOC Error Message.\r\n\r\n[1] https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-palombini-core-oscore-edhoc/\r\n[2] https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8613#section-2",

I think this needs to be addresses. Either we remove the signature curve from the cipher suite completely or we specify it as a profiling of the public key. Profiling the public key is however problematic as it is not a COSE key and may be any PKIX algorithm that may not even be standardized for COSE at all.

Selected cipher suite not supported (include SUITES_R in message)\r\n3. Credential/context error (error related to establish certificate/raw public key context for processing message, including certificate expired, revoked, unsupported, corrupt, unknown CA, or other issue in processing the credential)\r\n4. Decrypt error (a cryptographic operation failed, including being unable to correctly verify a signature or a MAC in the protocol message)\r\n5. Auxiliary data error (unsupported or missing auxiliary data)\r\n6. Access denied (credential valid but peer not allowed access)\r\n7. Internal error (error not related to the protocol or the peer)\r\n\r\nSelected comments during Hackathon:\r\n- Relation to errors on other layer, e.g. CoAP errors or error in application. \r\n- - EDHOC does not require CoAP so could have use for specified own errors.\r\n- - Does \"5. AD error\" belong to EDHOC?  Perhaps, auxiliary data provides means for security applications to reuse EDHOC and this would be a channel to send errors in those applications. [Not sure if this helps but, alternatively, errors could be encoded as auxiliary data, which may require an AD-field in the error message]\r\n- - Does \"6. Access denied\" belong to EDHOC? Perhaps, it provides a suitable error to the requirement \"Verify that the identity of the Responder is an allowed identity for this connection\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther comments are welcome. Happy to make the list shorter if possible. ",

Of the 2-byte long encodings, there there would be ~3x256 inhabited ones (unlike now, ~256): We could use the 256 `18 xx` (for xx > 24 as those would be encoded in a single byte), `38 xx` (again, xx < 24 staying uninhabited) and the `41 xx` (1-long byte strings) values.\r\n\r\nWhether this makes implementation harder or easier is IMO dependent on the programming style; for me it'd make things easier.

(Gut feeling says no because an attacker can replay a previous EDHOC exchange with them).\r\n\r\nIt may be helpful to also outline how a monotonous counter (similar to that of OSCORE B.1.1) can be used together with a private secret to obtain sufficient randomness.

(The response could still be replayed from an adversary that intercepted message_1 in an earlier iteration of this, stopped message_2 from reaching the device and then injected it now -- but that only gives the attacker one flash write for one time the attacker intercepts messages, and doesn't put the attacker in any better a position than other replays do).",

      "body": "EDHOC looks to me like it should be usable in situations where one party has no need (or intention) to authenticate, but still wants to authenticate the other party or just use opportunistic encryption.\r\n\r\nOne use case might be a constrained device A obtaining the certificate indicated by device B in the A-B EDHOC exchange from the certificate URI at C indicated by B. A has no need to present credentials (C hosts the certs publicly), but doesn't want to reveal to passive evesdroppers that it's talking to B. It doesn't need to authenticate C, but that might still be a good idea to lock out active MITMs.\r\n\r\nMy impression is that this is possible with EDHOC as it is and that EDHOC is suitable for the task (if not, stop reading and tell me).\r\n\r\nIf it is suitable, would both of these work?\r\n* Create (in COSE) a key ID type where a RPK that is CRED_x can be transported in ID_CRED_x (useful where you want to come back w/o having any original claims on first use)\r\n* Have a key where your ID_CRED_x says \"just what my ephemeral key is\".

It would be messy to have to types of public key formation and algorithms. Only using X.509 / C509 seems simpler in my view.\r\n- A new type in C509 naturally allows optional sending of parameters like key usage, subject name, and life time, which might be useful in a RPK setting as well. \r\n\r\nBelow is an example using the example certificate in the C509 draft.

If phrased more concisely (\"C_I is sent, C_R is omitted\"), it'd need a paragraph that states that \"The above statements about sending or omitting C_x only refer to the first positions in the messages; the C_I in Message 1 and C_R in Message 2 are always sent\".

E.g. if the responder receives `message_1` over CoAP and the responder plays a CoAP server, the Responder knows that the value of `corr` is `1`. If the CoAP server receives a POST trigger as in Fig. 8 in EDHOC-05, and then sends `message_1` in the 2.04 response, the EDHOC Responder-CoAP client knows that the value of `corr` is `2`. That said, my question is why do you need to transport `corr` on the wire? Is there any counter example where `corr` is not uniquely determined from the transport itself? Could you not integrity-protect `corr` without transporting it on the wire?",

To achieve even higher security it is RECOMMENDED that additional operations such as ephemeral key generation, all computations of shared secrets, and storage of the PRK keys can be done inside the TEE. The use of a TEE enforces that code within that environment cannot be tampered with, and that any data used by such code cannot be read or tampered with by code outside that environment.

This seems to unesicarily increase complexity and make implementations bigger. Comparing with TLS this would be like stating that you need to check the every cipher suite, extension, certificate format etc has been pre-approved for use with a certain endpoint. Are any of the checks strictly needed for security reasons? Otherwise I think these kind of checks should be part of an optional policy mechanism outside of EDHOC.",

Therefore only message_2 is discussed below.\r\n\r\n- Connection IDs - It has been discussed to make conection IDs mandatory (or default). Given the current connection id encoding this would add 1 byte to message_2 when sent in CoAP response. Note that there has also been suggested to move connection ids to a shim layer. This would not affect the total overhead, just move bytes from EDHOC to lower layers. If connection ids are kept in EHOC I think EDHOC should adopt Christians suggestion for encoding.\r\n\r\n- bstr_identifier - Is has been pointed out that the bstr_identifier is complicated and looks like overopimization, adding complexity to spec and implementations. Christian has some excellent suggestions on how to encode the connection identifiers. Then the bstr_identifier is only use to encode ID_CRED containing kid. This optimisations could maybe be skipped. This would add 1 byte to message_2 when certain 1 byte KIDs are used. I think this should be done unless the byte saving is very much needed.\r\n\r\n- Known lengths - There are several bstr whose length is known. E.g. G_Y and Signature_or_MAC_2. Concatenating G_Y and CIPHERTEXT_2 would save 1-2 bytes. The known length of Signature_or_MAC_2 is harder to use as a change would mean that the plaintext is no longer a CBOR sequance. Changing plaintext to be a CBOR SEQUENCE concatenated with the value of Signature_or_MAC_2 would save an additional 1-2 bytes. I don't think any of these optimizations should be done unless the byte savings are essential.\r\n\r\nThe above addition/removal of optimizations needs to be discussed together with a renewed discussion of the limits in 6TiSCH. In the end it is a tradeoff between complexity and how many deployments should be supported with unfragmented message_2.",

It would take complexity out of EDHOC itself, move it to the EDHOC-over-foo layers -- but it seems to me that all those correlation topics are easier to describe there, reducing over-all complexity.\r\n\r\nConcrete changes would be:\r\n\r\n* Mentions of the corr parameter would go away from everywhere thy are now; METHOD_CORR would just become METHOD (2 bits rather than 4).\r\n* All the data_x items that now have leading `? C_x` would drop them.\r\n* \"Message correlation\" would be added to the transport (applicability statement) requirements.\r\n* The CoAP applicability statement would grow by text like this:\r\n\r\n> Whenever an EDHOC message is sent from a client to a server in the payload, the EDHOC message is prefixed with the CBOR serialization of the C_x the server picked; in a message_1 (as the server has not picked the C_x), a `null` (encoded as `f6`) is sent there instead. The server uses this first CBOR item to identify the ongoing exchange, and uses the remainder of the payload as an EDHOC message.\r\n>\r\n> As a side note, this means that while responses in an exchange of EDHOC over CoAP are of media type application/edhoc, the requests are not, and there is currently no media type that describes \"application/edhoc with an identifier prefixed\". This is more of a theoretical concern, as EDHOC exchanges are not typically accompanied by explicit content formats.\r\n\r\nThese two paragraphs (of which only one is essential) can be much shorter as the stripped-out text, because not only does all the talk about encoding and naming the correlations gets dropped, but also the roles are clearer: We don't have to talk of \"C_I in this case, C_R in that case\", but (now that we have the terminology of server and client provided by CoAP) can talk of \"the C_x picked by the server\".\r\n\r\n(A side effect of this phrasing \"in the payload\" is that it'd trivially ensure that the EDHOC option from draft-palombini-core-oscore-edhoc-02 would be sent without the C_i which was considered for manual stripping-out anyway as it'd be redundant with the kid from the OSCORE option).",

CWT is also very flexible.\r\n- When CWT exist it would be strange to standardize a new format for transfereing a COSE_Key unless it is really really needed to save bytes.\r\n- CWT + Deterministic CBOR could maybe replace the discussion on how to integrity protect COSE_Keys. We should at least remove the new subject_name from the COSE_Key part in the EDHOC document. CWT and C509 can be used when subject name is needed.

It is recommended to transport EDHOC in CoAP payloads, see {{coap}}.\r\n\r\nWhile doing the review of the PR, I commented:\r\n\r\n> How come it is \"recommended\" to transport EDHOC in CoAP? The fact that CoAP is the most frequent use case for transporting EDHOC does not make it a \"recommended\" transport IMO.",

That would also simplify the initial parsing of credentials, since a dedicated COSE header parameter (rather than the type of the CBOR item) tells you the exact credential format.\r\n\r\nThis applies also beyond EDHOC, in case these formats are generally used to upload/distribute public keys, e.g. in the ACE Group Manager for Group OSCORE [1]. In that particular case, the same exact format has to be used by all the members of a same group for their public keys. Thus, having two distinct parameters \"cwt\" and \"uccs\" prevents possible ambiguity/misunderstanding to handle if there is only one parameter meaning \"cwt or uccs\".\r\n\r\n[1] https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ace-key-groupcomm-oscore/",

Then all non-CNSA suites would come in pairs.\r\n\r\nThat is very intentional. The GCM cipher suite uses X25519 for key exchange and ECDSA for authentication. This seems to be the dominant choice for HTTPS on the Web. Unless you are constrained you typically use X25519 for key exchange for speed and ECDSA for authentication as that is what the CAs support.\r\n\r\nFor an IoT device you probably want to have a single curve implemented. Also it might be much easier to switch to EdDSA as you might not have to rely on Global CAs and all other HTTPS nodes to support EdDSA. You can just deploy you own CWT server and make sure the nodes in you new IoT deployment support EdDSA.\r\n\r\nI have not heard any IoT people very interested in GCM. People seems far more interested in ChaCha20.",

          "body": "In general, I think that this approach is a cleaner way to solve the issue than what we had with CORR. Still, as discussed in #117, in order to implement this, interaction between three different protocol implementations is needed: EDHOC to negotiate connection identifiers, OSCORE/application for uniqueness requirements and CoAP/transport layer to transport them. The text is not very clear on how this interaction happens. While this is an implementation decision, it would still be good to organize the text in such a way that a clean separation of concerns is described. \r\n\r\nOne way of doing this would be to split \"Connection Identifiers and Transport\" into two separate sections: \r\n* \"Connection Identifiers\", and \r\n* \"Transport\". \r\n\r\nI would further split the \"Connection Identifiers\" section into three subsections, e.g:\r\n \r\n1) \"CID Negotiation\", \r\n2) \"CID Selection\", and \r\n3) \"CID Transport\".\r\n\r\nThe goal is to describe a clear flow and who does what. For instance, EDHOC calls an OSCORE API which proposes the CID, EDHOC negotiates the CID by exchanging EDHOC messages, EDHOC sets the CIDs to the underlying transport as soon as the CIDs are available. Transport module decides when to send and when to omit the CIDs depending on its correlation properties. The text should be general of course to account for other applications and transports. Would that make sense?\r\n\r\nP.S. I am missing normative text in the CoAP transport case mandating the transport of connection identifiers for different messages (in Section 7.2 ?). Am I missing the reason why there is no normative text at all in Section 7?",

The PR which was merged addressed much of these comments.\r\n* split \"Connection Identifiers and Transport\" into two separate sections\r\n* split the \"Connection Identifiers\" section into subsections \r\n    * CID Selection\r\n    * Use of CID in EDHOC\r\n    * Use of CID in OSCORE\r\n    * and expanded text about CID transport in the new Transport section\r\n\r\nThe second split was not exactly what was requested but it made more sense to me: The concept of \"CID negotation\" was redundant in the draft and replaced with \"CID Selection\" in a few occurences, wherefore a separate section of CID negotation was not needed. Having one section about CID Transport and then immediately followed by a section about Transport lead to duplicated text so I settled for a reference to the latter section. \r\n\r\nI did not include any text about OSCORE API which seemed too implementation specific. \r\n\r\nAbout normative text for CoAP transport of connection identifier, I don't know why that is needed. How EDHOC messages are transported is application dependent. If desirable an applicability statement can state that they use connection identifiers as described in A.3. I don't think adding normative text makes a difference. \r\n\r\nIf you think this is missing, or something else was missed in this comment, please make separate issues. Thanks.\r\n",
